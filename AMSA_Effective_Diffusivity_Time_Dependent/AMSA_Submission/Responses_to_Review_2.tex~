  space-time periodic incompressible flows''}

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Overall, the manuscript is difficult to follow. The text
  would need more structure. The reader is sometimes lost in a very
  long section, and does not know what has been addressed, what
  remains to be done,...  It would be nice to split Sections 1 and 2
  into several subsections, and to describe, at the beginning of each
  of them, what will be done in that subsection. The reader needs a
  better guideline.   
%
\item  In order to give the reader a better guide to the paper, in the
  revised manuscript we have split various sections into subsections
  with introductary paragraphs. We have also given more prompts about
  where the current section is leading.  
%
\item[2.] In order to convey their message, I think that the authors
  should work out a simple example (for instance, a purely diffusive
  problem in a time-independent setting) very early in their
  manuscript, in an informal manner. The different quantities at hand
  in this work (the corrector problem, the eigenvalue problem (A)
  below, the spectral measure $\mu$, the operators $Q(\lambda)$, . . . ) would
  appear, and their relation one to each other would be very clear. It
  would help the reader understand the overall strategy in a simple
  case.
